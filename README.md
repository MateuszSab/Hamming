# Hamming
In information theory, the Hamming distance between two strings of equal length is the number of positions at which the corresponding symbols are different. In other words, it measures the minimum number of substitutions required to change one string into the other, or the minimum number of errors that could have transformed one string into the other.
If sequences have different lenghts it returns None, because we can't compute Hamming distance for sequences not equal in lenghts.
